# Quantum Security Assessment with Shor Code

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a quantum security assessment using the Shor error-correcting code. The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the security of a quantum system against potential attacks and vulnerabilities.

**Note**: This code has been successfully executed on the IBM Quantum platform.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Qiskit**: You must have Qiskit installed. You can install it using `pip install qiskit`.

2. **IBM Quantum Account**: If you intend to run this code on the IBM Quantum platform, you'll need an IBM Quantum account to access their quantum devices and services.

## Execution on IBM Quantum

This script has been executed on the IBM Quantum platform to verify its functionality and security assessment capabilities. The assessment was performed on real quantum hardware, providing practical insights into quantum security.

## Script Description

The provided Python script conducts a quantum security assessment with the following steps:
this is intended for educationnal use and collaboration you can tailor ot to detect differnt attacks collaboration is wanted experts are needed lets fight back aganst makware attacks remanber to use this and tailor to fit into your project this is created for the security community to build upon with quantun computing yiu can hybride yiur security system inti this ti enhance the security in classical computing
